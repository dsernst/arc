## Overview
This system was primarily designed to provide 30kwh of daily capacity for our Burning Man camp. It provides 24vdc electricity because we have found that to be best compromise in terms of energy efficency and appliance requirements.

Given that it is not a super common standart (vs 100-220vac) we also started to design custom appliances that benefit from it by being oders of magnitude more efficent than off the shelf solutions.

## Todo's
Easy status monitoring
Easy to track down and fix issues
Maximize hardware utilization
Easy & cheap to build
Mass manufacturable
Inter arc load balancing
